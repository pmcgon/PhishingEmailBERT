## Overview
This repository contains a phishing email classification model built using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** and fine-tuned with TensorFlow. The model is trained to classify emails as either phishing or not phishing based on their subject and body content.

## Features

- Uses BERT for natural language understanding.

- Preprocesses email subject and body text for classification.

- Trained using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.

- Evaluates model performance with accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score.

- Provides sample predictions on test email examples.
